This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

## Testing

We use Jest with Testing Library to cover UI and domain logic. Helpful commands:

```bash
npm run test           # run the full suite once (passWithNoTests enabled)
npm run test:watch     # re-run impacted suites on file changes
npm run test:coverage  # generate text + HTML coverage output
```

- Global setup lives in `jest.setup.ts` where Next.js specific hooks and providers are mocked.
- Shared render helpers are available from `test-utils` (`tests/utils/test-utils.tsx`). Update this file when new global providers are introduced.
- Place component tests next to the implementation using `__tests__` folders or `*.test.tsx` suffixes. Jest automatically ignores build artefacts under `.next`.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
